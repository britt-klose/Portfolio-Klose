            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                     Brittany graduated from college at the University of Tampa, in May of 2021 with a degreee in marketing. 
                After moving back home to Pennsylvania, and taking some time off she realized she wanted to explore more fields. Coding was something she had always wanted to 
                try, but had never done before. She decided to try, and began the Coding Bootcamp with Upenn. She quickly found a passion in it
                and soon her horizon was broadened. Since then she has completed many great projects as can be seen below under work.
